# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Installing
1. Cloning the repository:
Open your terminal on your computer and use the following command to clone the repository:


````git clone https://github.com/vitaliikovalkovskyi/VapeShop.git````
<br>
<br>

2. Navigate to the project folder:
Move to the cloned project folder using the command:


````cd VapeShop````
<br>
<br>

3. Install Node.js:
If Node.js is not already installed on your computer, <br> download and install it from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en).
<br>

4. Install dependencies:
Use Yarn to install all project dependencies. Run the command:


````yarn run dev````

6. Run the development server:
After installing dependencies, start the project in development mode using the command:


````yarn run dev````
<br>
<br>
7. View in the browser:
Once the development server is running, open your web browser and go to ````http://localhost:5173```` <br> (or a different URL if it differs) to view the deployed project.
